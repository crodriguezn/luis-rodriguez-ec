            <h2>We are a locally-owned family company</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
                Gaviota Construction was started by Harold Fajardo and his wife Ma del Carmen in May of 2002. After years of working in corporate business management, the Fajardos wanted to start something of their own. Friends Benjamin, Hector, and David were working in construction at the time and encouraged the Fajardos to pursue something in the field. They started a new business in Minnesota as construction subcontractors. After gaining experience in all types of job-sites, the Fajardos began to develop their own ideas of how things should be done.

            <p style="text-align: justify">
                The Fajardos wanted to ensure the highest-quality work for their clients and let the customers be a part of the project. They invited feedback from customers and made sure the customer’s original vision was being carried out at the construction site. The Fajardos recognized that construction work is not just about construction but about the family that lives in the home they are working on. They looked at each house they worked on as if it was their own. As subcontractors who managed labor but not complete jobs, they were often unsatisfied with how customers were being treated in their own homes.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
                In the end, the Fajardos decided to take matters into their own hands and leave the world of subcontracting. After lots of studying and hard work, Harold passed the exam to receive his independent general contractor’s license for the company. Since then, the Fajardos have lived their dream of running a construction business and providing top-quality work to all their customers. Harold and Ma del Carmen would like to show their appreciation to the entire community of Minnesota for their support and business for the last 8 years in the industry. The Fajardos hope is to continue giving back to the community through their construction business for many years. Outside of the business, Harold and Ma del Carmen live on the east side of St. Paul with their three daughters Selene, Gabriela, and Paloma and a little Chihuahua dog.

                While there are so many variables that have contributed to our success, there has been no greater influence than by my lovely parents, Rafaela Lopez Gonzalez & Hugo Fajardo Secaira. Without their support and love, we would not be who we are and where we stand today as a company.
